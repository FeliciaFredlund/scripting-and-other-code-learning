# Descriptions of All Sorting Algorithms

Here I will have a short-ish description of each sorting algorithm (taking from boot.dev or wikipedia or own words). I'm doing this so I can try reimplementing the sorting algorithms myself whenever I feel like it without having to look up descriptions which might give hints in how to do it.

## Bubble sort


## Merge sort


## Insert sort


## Quick sort


## Selection sort
