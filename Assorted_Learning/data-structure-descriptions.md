# Descriptions of All Data Structures

Here I will have a short-ish description of each data structure (taking from boot.dev or wikipedia or own words). I'm doing this so I can try implementing the data structures myself whenever I feel like it without having to look up descriptions which might give hints in how to do it.

## Stack


## Queue


## Linked List


## Binary Tree


## Red Black Tree


## Hashmap


## Try/Tries


## Graph
